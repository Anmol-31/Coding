 Keys
'''
# Keys can be any immutable data type
# tuple can also be keys but only if they contain strings,numbers,tuples
#  if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key
# You canâ€™t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like append() and extend()
# Dictionary are set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary)
