'''
2 loops :-
    1. for
    2. while

for loop
    for statement iterates over items of any sequence in the order that
    they appear in the sequence

a n m o l
0 1 2 3 4

[0,1,3,4,5]
 0 1 2 3 4
 at o index item is 1
'''

# a=[1,4,2,5,3,42,-1,2]
# b=0
# #for i in range(0,len(a)):
# #    print(f"at {i} index item is {a[i]}")
# for i in a:
#     print(f"at {b} index item is {i}")
#     b+=1
#     if(b >= 2):
        # break



'''
Using Else With For Loops
Else Clause in For loop gets executed when no break occurs inside a for loop
'''
# for i in range(5):
#     print(i)
#
# else:
#     print('ok')
'''
Range func.
'''
# for i in range(5):
#     print(i)
# print(list(range(5)))
# print(type(range(5)))


# for i in range(5):
#     print(i)
# for i in list(range(5)):
#     print(i)
#
# for i in [0,1,2,3,4]:
#     print(i)


'''FOR LOOP COMPLETED'''



'''
WHILE LOOP

Just like any other while loop

every while loop will have indirectly 3 things:-
a) initialization variable ( loop variable in this case)
b) condition (on which it will depend whether loop will be executed or not)
c) update expression

'''


i=2 #Initialisation variable
while i<=5:# Conditional statement
    print(i)
    i+=1 # Update expression

#run this code
